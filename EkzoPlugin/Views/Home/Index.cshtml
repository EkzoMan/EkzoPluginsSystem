    <h2>Description</h2>
    EkzoPluginSystem is ASP.NET MVC 4 based implementation of plugin architecture.<br />
    Plugin architecture based on "precomplited views", generated by <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1f6ec6ff-e89b-4c47-8e79-d2d68df894ec" target="_blank">RazorGenerator tool</a>.<br />
    <br />
    Core project contains functions to load plugins, navigate to plugins content and control web application lifecycle.<br />
    Each plugin is independent website(web application), so you can develope it without adding core site to solution.<br />
    General information can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/EkzoMan/EkzoPluginsSystem/wiki">Wiki page</a>.
